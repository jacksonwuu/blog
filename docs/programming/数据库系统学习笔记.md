-   Transaction Concurrency Problems

    -   Dirty Read
    -   Repeated Read
    -   Phantom Read

-   Transaction isolation levels (high->low)

    -   Serializable
    -   Repeatable Read
    -   Read Committed
    -   Read Uncommitted

-   Isolation implementation

    -   Locking
        -   likes 2PL.
    -   Timestamps
        -   Ensure data items access order by timestamp (or serial number). Each data item holds two timestamps, read timestamp and write timestamp, and each transaction get a timestamp when it start.
    -   Multi-version and snapshots
        -   No lock, no waiting, good performance, widely adopted.
